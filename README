Nginx Library Auto-Discovery Module
-----------------------------------

Description
-----------

This module searches for compiled versions of OpenSSL, PCRE and Zlib so that
if they are required for an Nginx compilation and compiled versions are available,
then the pre-compiled versions are used rather than re-compiling new ones each
time Nginx is built.

It is likely to be of most interest to anyone who regularly compiles Nginx from
source.



Installation
------------

The module can be added like any other, but it MUST BE THE LAST ADDON MODULE, 
since it checks values set by other modules to determine whether or not libraries
are required.

./configure [other config options] --add-module=/path/to/ngx_auto_lib



Specifying paths
----------------

There are two ways to specify paths to library directories. The first is to set
variables [PREFIX]_INC and [PREFIX]_LIB before configure.

e.g.
export OPENSSL_LIB=/path/to/openssl/lib
export OPENSSL_INC=/path/to/openssl/include     # without the additional /openssl

Alternatively, the conventional method of setting paths in the configure script
are valid.

e.g.
--with-openssl=/path/to/openssl

Note : Unlike the normal setting, the /path/to/openssl can be EITHER A SOURCE DIR
(e.g. where Nginx has previously built a library from source) OR AN INSTALLATION DIR.
The module will test both types of path if they exist.



Automatically searching for user-compiled folders
-------------------------------------------------

If no exact directory is specified (by either of the above methods), the there are
two folders under which build directories are searched. The first can be set by
[PREFIX]_BASE, and the second is the directory that the Nginx source is located in.

When doing auto-searches, a search is made for all directories beginning with the
standard prefix for the library (e.g. openssl-), and the directories are tested for
valid installations, starting with the most recent version.

e.g. There are two directories 'openssl-0.9.8m' and 'openssl-1.0.0a' in the same
directory that the Nginx source is located in. The first of these that is tested is
version 1.0.0a, then 0.9.8m.

These tests are automatic if no exact path is given anywhere, but can be turned off
by setting [PREFIX]_NO_SEARCH_BASE and [PREFIX]_NO_SEARCH_SRC_DIR respectively to
any non-empty value.



Using system libraries
----------------------

If no exact paths are given, and the user-compiled versions of the libraries yield
no usable builds, then some standard system paths are searched. Currently the tests
are for /usr/local /usr /usr/pkg /opt/local - though this can be easily changed by
changing the path in the config file.

These tests can be turned off by setting [PREFIX]_NO_SEARCH_SYSTEM to any non-empty
value.



Variables to export
-------------------

PREFIX ::= OPENSSL | PCRE | ZLIB

[PREFIX]_LIB                path to lib dir
[PREFIX]_INC                path to include dir
[PREFIX]_BASE               directory to search for user-compiled versions of libraries
[PREFIX]_NO_SEARCH_BASE     do not search in directories under the folder [PREFIX]_BASE
[PREFIX]_NO_SEARCH_SRC_DIR  do not search in directories under the source folder
[PREFIX]_NO_SEARCH_SYSTEM   do not search in the default system folders

e.g.

PCRE_LIB=/usr/local/pcre/lib
PCRE_INC=/usr/local/pcre/include
ZLIB_NO_SEARCH_SYSTEM=1



TODO :

- PCRE + ZLIB
- check that reordering of mail modules in OpenSSL config file does not cause problems
